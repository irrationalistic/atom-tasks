# Tasks Package

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irrationalistic/atom-tasks/master/images/tasks_example.png)

Special formatting for .todo and .taskpaper files. Allows you to easily add, complete, and archive your tasks.

Adjust the settings to match your ideal style. Change all the markers to '-' to match taskpaper.

Any line that ends with `:` will be considered a header (like `My Things:`)

Add tags to tasks by starting them with an `@`, such as `@important` or setting a value like `@due(tuesday)`.

This uses utf characters, so it is still valid as a plain text document.

You can also set a custom date/time format in the settings. These can be converted in an existing document using the Tasks: Update Timestamp Format.

Based off the awesome sublime text plugin https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks
