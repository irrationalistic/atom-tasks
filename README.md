# Tasks Package

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irrationalistic/atom-tasks/master/images/tasks_example.png)

Special formatting for .todo and .taskpaper files. Allows you to easily add, complete,
and archive your tasks.

Adjust the settings to match your ideal style. Change the markers to '-' to match
taskpaper.

This is based primarily off of https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks

Any line that ends with : will be considered a header (like My Things:)

This uses utf characters, so it is still valid as a plain text document.

You can also set a custom date/time format in the settings. These can be converted
in an existing document using the Tasks: Update Timestamp Format.
